**Easy Vegan Sugar Cookies**
INGREDIENTS
For the Cookies:

1/2 cup (112g) Vegan Butter

3/4 cups (150g) Sugar

1 tsp Vanilla Extract

1/4 tsp Almond Extract

2 cups (250g) All Purpose Flour

1 tsp Baking Soda

2 Tbsp Soy Milk (or other non-dairy milk)

For the Decorating Frosting:

1 cup (120g) Powdered (Confectioners) Sugar

1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract

1 Tbsp Soy Milk (or other non-dairy milk)

INSTRUCTIONS

**Preheat** the oven to 350°F (180°C)

**Cream** the vegan butter and sugar together and then add the vanilla extract and almond extract.

**Sift** the flour into a mixing bowl and add the baking soda and salt.

**Add** the dry ingredients to the wet and mix in by hand until crumbly. Add soy milk and mix in to create a big ball of dough. If your mix is too crumbly to form a ball of dough, add in a little more soy milk until it does.

**Flour** your hands and a baking mat and transfer the ball of dough to the baking mat.
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to around 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, dip a cookie cutter into flour so it doesn’t stick and cut out your cookies. Transfer the cookies to a parchment lined baking tray. With the remaining dough, form it into a ball and then roll it out again and repeat.

**Bake** in the oven for 10 minutes.

**Remove** from the oven and allow to cool completely before decorating.

**Prepare** your decorating frosting by adding the powdered sugar, vanilla and soy milk to an electric mixing bowl. Start on low speed and gradually increase speed until smooth. If you need a little more soy milk then add it a drop at a time so that you don’t use too much. The consistency will be very sticky, almost gluey. Separate into 2 bowls. Add a drop of food coloring into each bowl and mix in.

**Decorate** the cookies and allow to set before serving.
